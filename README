To get the project Makefile working properly you must set some environment variables first.
Set:
	PYTHIA8="pythia installation directory"
	PYTHIA8DATA=$PYTHIA8/xmldoc
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$PYTHIA8/lib

if you use MAC OSX replace the last line by

	DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:$PYTHIA8/lib
